/*
An odious number is defined as a number with an odd amount of 1s in its binary expansion. 4 is an example of this as it is "100" in binary and thus is an odious number.

Output true or false depending on if the input, x, is odious or not.
Input
x is a nonnegative integer
Output
true or false
Constraints
0â‰¤x
Example
Input
4
Output
true
